# GamersHub | A community for gamers
GamersHub is an android app which is meant for gamers to interact, share their achievements and catch the latest updates of thier favourite games. This is my first ever android
project. 
I have used back4app parse server to store all the data. To ask runtime permissions I have used Dexter android library(https://github.com/Karumi/Dexter).
And for the icons for my app I have used Flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/).
Feel free to try this app out and give some new suggestion <3
